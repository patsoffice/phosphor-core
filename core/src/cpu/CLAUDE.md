# CPU Implementation Guidelines

## README Maintenance

- Update the CPU-specific README.md (e.g., `m6502/README.md`, `m6809/README.md`) when adding instructions, addressing modes, or changing opcode counts
- Each CPU directory has its own README.md documenting architecture, instruction set, file structure, and resources
